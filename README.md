#  Tree of Clarifications (ToC)

This is the official repository for our EMNLP 2023 paper:
[Tree of Clarifications: Answering Ambiguous Questions with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14696)


## Summary
We propose a novel framework, <b>Tree of Clarifications (ToC)</b> designed for generating long-form answers to ambiguous questions.
- It guides LLMs to explore diverse interpretations of ambiguity in <u>a tree structure with the ability to prune</u> unhelpful ones
-  We investigate combining <u>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLM</u> and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on ASQA

## Environments

To facilitate a smooth setup, we suggest creating a Conda environment using the provided configuration::
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the newly created environment with:
```
conda activate toc
```

## Preparing the Dataset
Access and download the ASQA dataset [here](https://github.com/google-research/language/tree/master/language/asqa) or utilize the pre-packaged version in our repository at `./asqa/ASQA.json`

> Note: this repo disabled the bing search components 

## Answering ambiguous questions with ToC

Before running ToC, you need to specify the following. Fill openAI API key by referring to the [homepage](https://openai.com/) and specify colbert server url. We utilized the server hosted by [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy). Please note that the hosting server may change. For setting up your server, refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT#running-a-lightweight-colbertv2-server)
```
export OPENAI_KEY= # your OpenAI API key here
export COLBERT_URL= 'http://ec2-44-228-128-229.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8893/api/search' 
```

To run ToC, use the following script, specifying the necessary paths and options:

```
export ASQA_DIR= # directory path to the ASQA dataset
export OUT_DIR= # directory path to results

python run_toc.py \
    --data_dir $ASQA_DIR \
    --bing_path $BING_PATH \ # Optional
    --openai_key $OPENAI_KEY \
    --colbert_url $COLBERT_URL \
    --verify \
    --output_dir $OUT_DIR \
    ${ARGS}
```

## Evaluating the long-form answers

To evaluate the answers generated by ToC, follow the guidelines provided in the [official ASQA repository](https://github.com/google-research/language/tree/master/language/asqa).
